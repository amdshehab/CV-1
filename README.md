### React Frontend Developer.

I am a frontend developer with a product development and design background who is passionate about modern technology. I believe in putting the user front and centre when approaching business problems. I enjoy collaborating closely with designers, PM’s and other developers to get cutting edge user-interfaces into the hands of customers, built using robust, readable code.
